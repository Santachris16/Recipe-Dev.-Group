      <h3>Directions</h3>

      <ol>
  <li>Heat the 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a large pan over medium high heat. Add the ground pork and season with salt and pepper.</li>
  <li>Cook, breaking up the pork with a spatula, until meat is browned and cooked through. Add the garlic and ginger then cook for 30 seconds.
  <li>Stir in the coleslaw mix and green onions. Cook until cabbage is wilted, about 3-4 minutes. 
  <li>Stir in the soy sauce and sesame oil, then remove from heat.
  <li>Spoon approximately 2-3 tablespoons of filling onto each egg roll wrapper and fold according to package directions, using the beaten egg to seal the edges of the wrappers as you go. 
  <li>Pour 2-3 inches of oil into a deep pot.
  <li>Heat the oil to 350 degrees. Fry 3-4 egg rolls at a time, turning occasionally, until browned all over, approximately 3-5 minutes.
  <li>Drain on paper towels, then serve with dipping sauce of your choice.
